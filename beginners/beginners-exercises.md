# Exercises

1. Find the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n.
2. Write a function that checks whether a given positive integer n is a prime number. If n is prime, the function should return true; otherwise, it should return false.
3. Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer n. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. For example, the factorial of 5 (denoted as 5!) is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.
4. Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. For example, "racecar" and "level" are palindromes. Your function should return true if the input string is a palindrome and false otherwise.
5. Write a function to find and return the maximum element in an array of integers. The function should take an array of integers as input and return the largest value in the array.
6.  Write a function that counts the occurrences of each character in a given string and returns the results as an object. The object should have characters as keys and their respective counts as values.
